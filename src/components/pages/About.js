            <p>I am a new web developer who has just completed Columbia University's Coding Bootcamp and earned a certificate in full-stack web development.</p>
            <p>After graduating from the University of Virginia, I moved to New York and have worked in operational roles for the last 8 years. Collaborating with the engineers and developers at my last company, a tech startup, inspired me to make a pivot.</p>
